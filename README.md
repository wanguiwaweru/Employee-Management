# Employee-Management Structure

### Work Flow

An admin creates employee accounts with name,email,title, department and isAdmin fields.

A user registers into site using username, email and password. They are redirected to sign in. 

If the user is an Admin, after sign in they can view all employees and they can view all leave application forms submitted.

If a user is not an Admin, they can view their profile and navigate to the leave application form where they can fill in to seek leave.
